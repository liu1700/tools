# Tools & Resources

## Curated Tool Resources

Recording efficient tools and resources used in AI product development over the past period. Most products offer free trials or pay-as-you-go models, suitable for quick project launches. Many products have alternatives and are continuously evolving - choose the tools with equivalent functionality that suit your needs.

### Core Principles
The free tier of SaaS services is usually sufficient in the early stages of projects - never worry too early about scaling issues. Choose the most convenient tools during initial product development, especially for independent products, avoid using complex platforms like AWS, Azure too early, always follow the principle of "start small and simple."
